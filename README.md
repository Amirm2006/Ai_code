 Here I post projects related to artificial intelligence.
 
 1.first project:
         
         My first project is about predicting house prices in Pardisan, Qom.


 2.project two:
         
         In my second project, I implemented a Softmax classifier to train a model that determines whether the user input is a number or an English letter.
         The current limitation is that the input must be a single character, for example: 5 or a.


3.project 3:
         
         My third project is about predicting land prices in a village, which I solved using linear regression.These projects have the possibility of being updated.
