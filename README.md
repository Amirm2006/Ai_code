 Here I post projects related to artificial intelligence.
 
 1.first project:
         My first project is about predicting house prices in Pardisan, Qom.
 2.project two:
         In my second project, I implemented a Softmax classifier to train a model that determines whether the user input is a number or an English letter.
         The current limitation is that the input must be a single character, for example: 5 or a.
