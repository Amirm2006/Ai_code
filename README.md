# AI-Related Projects

This repository contains several projects related to artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Project 1: House Price Prediction in Pardisan, Qom

In this project, I developed a model to predict house prices in Pardisan, Qom using [method/algorithm if you want to specify]. The goal was to analyze housing market data and estimate prices based on relevant features.

## Project 2: Softmax Classifier for Character Recognition

This project involves implementing a Softmax classifier to train a model that classifies user input as either a number or an English letter.  
**Limitation:** The input is restricted to a single character, such as '5' or 'a'.

## Project 3: Land Price Prediction in a Village

The third project focuses on predicting land prices in a rural area. I approached the problem using linear regression techniques to estimate land values based on input features.

## Project 4:

I implemented a neural network to practice classification of input characters, determining whether the given input is a digit, an uppercase letter, or a lowercase letter.

### Note

These projects are continuously updated and improved over time.
